# Let's create a way to store a collection of data and functions to organise our stocks
# We should store the stock ticker (it's name), it's current price, the price we bought it at,
# and the price history. It might be good to have it's sector as well

# Create a new stock

# Change the price of the stock, 
# let's do it 3 ways. Either, providing a new price,
# The monetary amount it changed by, or the percentage change
# Make sure to add any changes to the price history!

# Calculate ROI

# Just like in Python 1, creating a text output to describe our stock will be nice to read!

# Display the price history of the stock, as tracked by your changes

# Now, let's create methods that help us work with a list of stocks
# total the value of all stocks

# total how much you bought portfolio for

# calculate your total return

# Determine which sectors you're invested in

# Use this to detemine the amount invested in each sector

# OPTIONAL - Make an app to test your code! 
# If you don't want to go through the trouble
# Hard code in a couple of stocks, collect them together,
# and test all the methods and functions you made!
