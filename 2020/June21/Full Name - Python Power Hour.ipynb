    "Upon running the code, the user will be provided with a prompt to perform one of many actions, including the following:\n",
    "* The user should be given an option to add a new bank account, with an account number and type (chequing, savings)\n",
    "* The user should be able to perform basic banking functions. At the very least, you she be able to:\n",
    "    * Make a deposit\n",
    "    * Make a withdrawal\n",
    "    * Transfer funds from one account to the other\n",
    "    * Get a report of all current account information\n",
    "    * Get the total amount of money between accounts\n",
    "    * Remove an account\n",
    "    * You can add additional features that you think would be useful!\n",
    "* Feel free to add appropriate error handling to make the user experience more responsive and intuitive\n",
    "* The user should also be able to exit anytime with the press of a button\n",
