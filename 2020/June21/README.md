# Power Hours: Python
## June 21 2020

Today, we will be creating a simple bank account manager. The idea is to take the fundamentals we learned in python 1 and create a simple but useful application.

Upon running the code, the user will be provided with a prompt to perform one of many actions, including the following:

* The user should be given an option to add a new bank account, with an account number and type (chequing, savings)
* The user should be able to perform basic banking functions. At the very least, you she be able to:
    * Make a deposit
    * Make a withdrawal
    * Transfer funds from one account to the other
    * Get a report of all current account information
    * Get the total amount of money between accounts
    * Remove an account
    * You can add additional features that you think would be useful!
* Feel free to add appropriate error handling to make the user experience more responsive and intuitive
* The user should also be able to exit anytime with the press of a button

The attached .py and .ipynb files are set up for you with some hints provided. If you don't want any help at all, you can start from a new file (we can go over this if you need help).

Feel free to ask questions throughout the session if you need help. If you finish early, I’d be happy to give you ideas on how to extend the project, and challenge you with concepts we haven’t covered in the bootcamps.

Good Luck!
