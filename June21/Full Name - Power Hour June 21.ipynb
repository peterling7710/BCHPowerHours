    "* The user should be given an option to add a new bank account, with an account number and type (chequing, savings)\n",

    "    * Make a deposit\n",
    "    * Make a withdrawal\n",
    "    * Transfer funds from one account to the other\n",
    "    * Get a report of all current account information\n",
    "    * Get the total amount of money between accounts\n",
    "    * Remove an account\n",
    "    * You can add additional features that you think would be useful!\n",
    "* Feel free to add appropriate error handling to make the user experience more responsive and intuitive\n",
    "* The user should also be able to exit anytime with the press of a button\n",
