In this repository you will find the content for all current and previous power hours. After a power hour is completed, the problem statement will still be available for you to look at, in case you missed the session, and still want some cool python projects to complete. 

In addition, a sample solution to the problem will be included after the power hour is finished. This is just one way that you might want to solve the problem, and you could certainly continue to add more functionality if you really want to go beyond the basic.

A list of power hour dates, as well as a small blurb on each project you will be working on is maintained on this readme.
